//Define abstract class Shape with only one abstract method CalculateSurface() and fields width and height. 
//Define two new classes Triangle and Rectangle that implement the virtual method and return the surface of the figure 
//(height*width for rectangle and height*width/2 for triangle). Define class Circle and suitable constructor so that at 
//initialization height must be kept equal to width and implement the CalculateSurface() method. 
//Write a program that tests the behavior of  the CalculateSurface() method for different shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) 
//stored in an array.
